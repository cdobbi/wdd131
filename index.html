W01 Assignment: Home Page
Overview
This assignment allows you to demonstrate your prerequisite knowledge by applying HTML and CSS in the design and development of a home page. In addition, you will be asked to apply learning activity concepts including JavaScript to provide some dynamic information.

Task
Design and develop the following home page using your own content and basic styling.

Example Home Page Screenshot
Figure 1: Example Home Page
Instructions
File and Folder Setup
In VS Code, open the wdd131 local repository folder.
Create a new page in this root folder named "index.html".
Why is this file named "index.html"?

Check Your Understanding
Create new folders (directories) named "styles", "scripts", and "images'.
These sub-folders, on the repository root directory, will contain the relevant, asset files.
Note that the words directory and folder have essentially the same meaning. Directory is the more accurate term for file systems while "folder" 📂 refers to the graphical metaphor that is generally accepted because it is highly related to the term file in the organized world.
Add a CSS file named "base.css" to the "styles" directory. This is your main CSS file.
Add a JS file named "getdates.js" to the "scripts" directory.
HTML
In the index.html document, include:
the required document type definition,
html tag with language attribute,
the head tag, and
the body tag.
In the <head>, include the following elements with appropriate attributes and content:
Refer to the course development standards if you need to review any of these <head> elements.
the meta charset attribute,
the meta viewport,
the title,
the meta description, and
the meta author.
Set the title content to "WDD 131 - Dynamic Web Fundamentals - Your Name".
Phrase the meta description content at least contain this content:
"WDD 131 - Dynamic Web Fundamentals"
Your full name
Keyword summary of page content
In the <body>, create a layout using a header, a main, and a footer element.
The <header> element contains:
the page heading as shown in an <h1> tag, and
a <nav> tag with these four menu links:
Your LinkedIn profile page.
If you do not have a free LinkedIn account profile, consider making one or just provide a general link to LinkedIn.
I-Learn using https://byui.instructure.com/.
Link to a favorite Scripture using https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures
Example
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7
Final Project folder link. This will just be a placeholder for now.
The <main> element contains the following:
Two section tags each with the class attribute named "card" where the headings are provided and the content example is shown in the figure above including an image. Use your own content and at least three (3) resource links.
All images used on web pages must be optimized in this class and must be local (no external, absolute references to images).

The <footer> has two paragraphs p:
The first paragraph contains the following:
The copyright symbol and current year where the year will be dynamically populated using JavaScript code. Provide a blank <span> tag to do this.
Example
<span id="currentyear"></span>
Your name.
Your state or country.
The second paragraph has an id of "lastModified" and will be populated with JavaScript code.
CSS
Use the external base.css file to layout and style the page as shown in the example screenshot above.

Use your color schema and typography choices.
You are responsible to practice good design principles of alignment, color contrast, proximity, repetition, and usability in all of your work.
Use the Google Fonts API to select one or two fonts to use on the page.
If you need help using Google Fonts, watch: Google Fonts API

Use CSS Flex on the navigation nav.
Demonstration: CSS Flex Navigation Menu
Source: CSS Flex Menu - CodePen
The navigation must employ a well designed hover affect. See the Codepen above for an example.
The main element has a limited width and is centered on the screen horizontally.
Layout the main column cards using CSS Grid.
JavaScript
Reference the "getdates.js" JavaScript file by using a <script> reference in the head of the HTML file and using the attribute defer.
Why is the defer boolean attribute important?
How else can we successful reference and employ JavaScript?
In getdates.js, write JavaScript statements that dynamically output the following:
the copyright year (the current year) in the footer's first paragraph, and
Note this CodePen summary of using the Date object in different ways.
the date the document was last modified in the second paragraph.
Use the lastModified property of the document object to get this date/time dynamically.
You do not need to alter the document.lastModified native format.
Testing
Testing Demonstration: ► Testing and Auditing your own work

Continuously check your work by rendering the page locally using Live Server in VS Code.
Screenshot of console error icon in DevToolsUse the browser's DevTools to check for JavaScript runtime errors in the console or click the red, error icon in the upper right corner of DevTools.
"DevTools" is an abbreviation for "Developer Tools." It refers to a set of tools or utilities provided by web browsers to help developers debug, profile, and analyze web pages during the development process. The tools are typically accessed by pressing the F12 function key or selecting the menu option for the browser's developer tools.
Use DevTools CSS Overview to check your color contrast.
Generate the DevTools Lighthouse report and run diagnostics for Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO in the Desktop view.
The DevTools Lighthouse tool serves as a comprehensive auditing tool integrated into the browser. In this class, we focus on accessibility, best practices, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and page weight measured by the total transfer bytes when the page is hard reloaded from an empty cache.

For more information, see the Lighthouse documentation.

It is best to test your page in a Private or Incognito browser window.
Hard reload the page using Empty Cache and Hard Reload in DevTools with the Network tab open to view the total transferred bytes at the bottom of the tab. Check that the page is 500 kB or less. The usually fixes at this point are:
Make sure that all images are optimized.
You are not allowed to use third party libraries that bloat your page.
Submission and Audit
Commit your local repository and push or upload your work to your GitHub Pages enabled wdd 131 repository on GitHub.
Use this ☑️ audit tool to self-check your work for some of the required HTML elements and CSS content. This audit tool is also used by the assessment team.
Share your work by posting your URL in the course's Microsoft Teams weekly forum and comment on your peers' work by providing constructive feedback.
Return to I-Learn and submit your GitHub Pages enabled URL for wdd131, e.g.,
https://your-github-username.github.io/wdd131
Note that we do not need to include index.html in our reference because index.html is the default file retrieved with a folder request.

<!-- The defer attribute is a boolean attribute that can be added to a <script> tag in HTML. When present, it specifies that the script should be executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed. This is particularly useful for scripts that manipulate the DOM, as it ensures that the DOM is fully loaded before the script runs.

    Key Points about defer
    Non-blocking: When a script has the defer attribute, it does not block the HTML parser. The browser continues to parse the HTML while the script is being fetched.
    Execution Order: Deferred scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document.
    DOM Ready: Deferred scripts are guaranteed to execute after the entire HTML document has been parsed, but before the DOMContentLoaded event. -->

<!-- Explanation -->
<!-- <script src="scripts/getdates.js" defer></script>: This line references the getdates.js file located in the scripts directory. The defer attribute ensures that the script is executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
Summary
The defer attribute is a boolean attribute that ensures the script is executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed. It allows the browser to continue parsing the HTML while the script is being fetched, and it guarantees that the script will run in the order it appears in the document, but only after the DOM is fully loaded. This is particularly useful for scripts that manipulate the DOM. -->

<!-- JavaScript at the End of the Body
You can place the <script> tag at the end of the <body> section. This ensures that the script is executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed, similar to using defer. -->

<!-- There are multiple ways to include and use JavaScript in an HTML document:

Inline JavaScript: Directly within the HTML file using the <script> tag.
External JavaScript with defer: Ensures the script is executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
External JavaScript with async: Allows the script to be downloaded in parallel with the HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available.
External JavaScript without defer or async: Blocks the HTML parsing until the script is downloaded and executed.
JavaScript at the End of the Body: Ensures the script is executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed.
Each method has its own use cases and benefits, and you can choose the one that best fits your needs. -->
