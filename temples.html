<!-- 
Here is the general syntax is setting up a CSS media query:

@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  /* CSS rules go here inside the @media query's opening and closing curly brackets {} */
}
Here is an example CSS media query which could be embedded in a CSS file or be the entire contents of a CSS file if wanted. This example only has one CSS rule.

@media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    margin: 1rem;
    color: navy;
  }
}
Sample code explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ The @media screen and (min-width: 640px) {is the signature line of the @media query block of CSS rules to be applied if the conditions are met. In this case the conditions are if the media type is a screen and the viewport minimum width is at least 640 pixels wide.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The h1 {is a heading 1 (<h1>) element selector which starts the defined CSS rule.

3Ô∏è‚É£-5Ô∏è‚É£ The @font-size: 2.5rem; margin: 1rem; color: navy; are declarations to be applied to any <h1> elements if the @media query conditions are met.

Activity Instructions
For this activity, you will create a simple HTML page with two CSS files. The first CSS file will be used to style the page for mobile devices. The second CSS file will be used to style the page for larger viewports. You will use CSS media queries to apply the appropriate CSS file based upon the viewport width.

In your media-query.html file, create a valid HTML page with standard head content including
Meta Charset Attribute
Meta Viewport Element
Title Element
Meta Description Element
Meta Author Element
Link to a Google Font named "Roboto" - regular 400.
Link references to your CSS two (2) files. Link the media-query.css file first.
Example
In the body of the HTML document, add a header with an h1, a main element with two section elements, and a footer element.
The h1 element should contain the words "Media Query Example".
Each section h2 heading contains a scripture with book, chapter, and verse.
The section paragraph contains a copy of the actual scripture referenced in the heading.
The footer should contain your name.
Example
CSS
Style the document as shown in the example screenshots given below.
media-query.css
Do not include a media query.
Use the Google Font - Roboto in the body rule.
The header, main, and footer each
have a maximum width of 640 pixels,
are centered on the page using margin: 1rem auto,
include a faint border,
use appropriate padding, and
have a blueish background color of your choice.
Remember that you can combine these three selectors into one rule or create a class that contains these common CSS declarations.

Declare the main element to be a CSS grid with a grid template of only one column, and a equal gap of 1rem, and
If you had a question to pose to the class in Microsoft Teams, use specific and descriptive language, e.g., "I have a question about the media-query assignment part 5.1.4. I do not know how to set the main element grid to only one column with an even gap of 1rem."

Declare the section elements to also have padding and a lighter or white background.
Check Your Understanding
In the media-query-large.css,
Write a containing media query to be applied at a viewport width of 500px or greater.
@media screen and (min-width: 500px)
Change through declaration within the media query the header to a black background with white text, and
Change the main element to display two columns of equal size.

<!-- W02 Assignment: Picture Album
Overview
This assignment applies the concepts presented in the learning activities to a picture album page that is responsive in small and larger views. This page will utilize a 'hamburger' menu and respond to user requests.

Associated Course Learning Outcomes
Task
Design, develop, test, and then deploy a temple album page using your own selections of temple pictures.

Example Picture Album Page Screenshot - Mobile

Demonstration of Responsive Behavior
responsive example
Instructions
File and Folder Setup
In VS Code, open the wdd131 local repository folder if it does not open automatically because it was your last working directory.
Create a new file named "temples.html".
Add two CSS files named "temples.css" and "temples-large.css" to the "styles" directory.
Add a JavaScript file named "temples.js" to the "scripts" directory.
HTML
In the temples.html document, include the standard HTML document and <head> elements.
Refer to the development standards if you need a review.

Add links to the CSS files in the proper order to support mobile first dev.
Add a deferred <script> reference to the JavaScript file.
In the <body>, create a basic layout using a header, a main, and a footer as main line elements.
The <header> element contains:
a heading that matches up with the title, and
a <nav> menu with the following text links:
Home
Old
New
Large
Small
You can build this navigation using straight up anchor <a> tags or using a common, unordered list <ul> with list items <li> and <a> tags. Of course, the structural decision you make affects how you will use CSS to style the vertical (mobile) and horizontal (larger) menu.
The <main> element contains the following:
a heading element with content matches the current menu selection,
at least (9) <figure> elements with temple images and captions. Use the built in figure captions elements and name the temple.
It is OK to have a single placeholder temple image at this point in the course. We will be adding additional functionality, including responsive image variations to this page in the coming weeks.
The <footer> contains the same dynamic and static information found on your home page from last week.
Common Footer Screenshot Example
Figure 3: Screenshot Example of Common Footer
CSS
Use the external temples.css and temples-large.css files to layout and style the page as shown is the example screenshots. Your design must support a responsive view in mobile and larger views.

The temples.css file is used for the mobile view and the temples-large.css file is used for the larger view. Most of your CSS should be located in the temples.css file in mobile first design
Use your own color schema.
Please note: You are responsible to practice good design principles of alignment, color contrast, proximity, repetition, and consistent spacing in all of your work.
Use your own typography choice by using the Google Fonts API service to select one or two fonts to use on the page.
Google Fonts Demonstration
Use CSS Flex on the navigation nav.
CSS Flex Navigation Menu - Demonstration Video
CSS Flex Menu Example - CodePen Source Code
Header Contained CSS Flex Example - CodePen Source Code
The navigation must employ a hover affect. See the CodePen above for an example.
The main element has a limited width and is centered on the screen horizontally.
Layout the main column figure elements using CSS Grid. In the mobile view, there should only be one (1) column.
The application of CSS Grid to support a responsive view is up to you. Some of the options could be:
‚Ä¢ use grid-template-column specific fr changes in the media query, or
‚Ä¢ use grid-template-column property with a repeat function and auto-fit and minmax function.
Example: Grid Column Layouts and Image Effects - CodePen

JavaScript
Remember that all of your JavaScript references in this class should be to external files.
Support the footer copyright year and date last modified output through a valid JavaScript reference. You already have one or could use the temples.js file.
Apply a responsive hamburger effect to your existing navigation menu using JavaScript.
The hamburger button should only show in the mobile view.
Clicking the hamburger button toggles the navigation menu items from viewable to not viewable.
Use a symbol, such as an 'X' to close the hamburger menu.-->
