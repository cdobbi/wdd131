            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p id="welcome-message">
                For three years, I stood firm, telling my daughter that we weren't going to get her a rabbit, but life has a funny way of
                changing plans.</p>
            <p>
                One day, our cat caught a tiny kit. We brought it inside, expecting to make it comfortable in
                its final moments. To our surprise, the little one didn't just survive—it thrived. That unexpected turn of events
                marked the beginning of our journey into the surprising and fascinating world of rabbitry. </p>
            <p>
                We discovered that people around the world show these adorable creatures competitively! 🙀 There are rabbit shows,
                hurdle jumping, and obstacle course competitions, clubs, organizations, 4-H and other groups dedicated to rabbits.
                The rabbit world is delightfully enormous!</p>
            <p>
                As neighbors heard about our new addition, they began to bring us their unwanted bunnies or injured feral
                buns. We bottle fed and mended wounds and quickly found ourselves with a small herd of rabbits each with
                its own unique story and in need of homes. </p>
            <p>
                Although we've grown our little rabbit village, we are still small, which allows us to focus on breeding quality pet
                and show animals. We are dedicated to providing the best care for our rabbits and ensuring they have a successful transition
                to their new homes.</p>
            <p>
                We hope you enjoy the cute pictures of some of the bunnies we've had or currently have. I included links to
                helpful webpages and will continue updating those as I discover additional reliable resources. Have fun learning about
                bunnies and feel free to contact us if you have any questions or are interested in purchasing a rabbit.</p>

            <h2>Poem</h2>
            <p>
                In fields where sunlight gently fades,<br>
                Beneath the leafy, whispering glades,<br>
                Live silent shadows, soft and light,<br>
                Hopping through the day and night.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Oh, gentle bunnies, so serene,<br>
                Embodiments of peace unseen,<br>
                In their quiet, modest grace,<br>
                They teach us how to find our place.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With every hop, in graceful stride,<br>
                Through open fields, and meadows wide,<br>
                They whisper secrets to the earth,<br>
                Of quiet strength, of gentle worth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In their eyes, pure glee does gleam,<br>
                A mirrored world where hope can dream,<br>
                So hop along, with joy and pride,<br>
                For in your hearts, all fears subside.<br>
